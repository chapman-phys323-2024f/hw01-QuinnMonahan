## Specification

Complete the following exercises, saving your solutions in the indicated files. 

1. Clone this hw01 repository from GitHub onto your computer using SSH. Remember to keep your files organized into folders as appropriate.
1. The format of the `README.md` files on GitHub (and any .md file) is a language called "Markdown". This is a markup language (hence the pun) that renders as fully formatted HTML (just like usual websites) while using only a few extra characters in the text document to indicate the intended formatting. Please read over the quickstart documentation provided by GitHub [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
1. In a new file `MarkdownTest.md` try out the various Markdown syntax features: bold text, italic text, bold+italic text, section headings, subsection headings, website links, block quotes, lists, numbered lists, and embedded images. Hint: If you use Jupyter-lab, it will render the Markdown nicely in real time so you can see how it looks before committing to GitHub. Show an example of each Markdown feature in the new file, then add/commit/push your new file to GitHub and verify that it renders correctly on the GitHub server as you intended.
